I am an assistant professor in the <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu">EECS department</a> at UC Berkeley.  My <a href="assets/joseph_gonzalez_research_statement.pdf">research interests</a> are at the intersection of machine learning and data systems and explore the challenges of distributed learning and inference on large models and datasets, real-time model serving and personalization, and applying ML techniques to system tuning and management.

<b>Co-founder:</b> I am also co-founder of <a href="http://Turi.com">Turi Inc.</a> (formerly GraphLab), which was originally based on my thesis work on the <a href="https://github.com/dato-code/PowerGraph">GraphLab & PowerGraph Systems</a>.  Turi was recently <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2016/exclusive-apple-acquires-turi-major-exit-seattle-based-machine-learning-ai-startup/">acquired</a> by Apple Inc.


<b>Background:</b> Before joining UC Berkeley as an assistant professor, I was a post-doc in the UC Berkeley <a href="https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu">AMPLab</a> working on several projects including <a href="http://spark.apache.org/graphx/">GraphX</a> (now part of <a href="http://spark.apache.org">Apache Spark</a>), early versions of <a href="http://mlbase.org">MLbase</a>, <a href="https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/projects/velox/">Velox</a>, and <a href="https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/projects/ccml/">concurrency control for ML</a>.
I got my PhD from the Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University
where I worked with <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~guestrin/">Carlos Guestrin</a> on <a href="assets/papers/jegonzal_thesis.pdf">Parallel and Distributed Systems for Probabilistic Reasoning</a>.  I am a recipient of the AT&amp;T Labs Graduate Research Fellowship and the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship.

## Prospective Graduate Students

I am looking for additional graduate students to join my active projects on large-scale systems for real-time machine learning.  If you are interested please consider applying to the UC Berkeley CS <a href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/academics/graduate/research-programs/admissions">graduate program</a> in <a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Areas/DBMS/">DBMS</a> or <a href ="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Areas/AI/">AI</a>.
