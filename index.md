Joseph is a Professor in the <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu">EECS department</a> at UC Berkeley, a co-director and founding member of the UC Berkeley [RISE Lab](http://rise.cs.berkeley.edu) and a member of the Berkeley AI Research ([BAIR](bair.berkeley.edu) Group).  His [research interests](research) span machine learning and data systems and he has a wide range of projects including:

* real-time model serving 
* large language models
* machine learning on edge devices
* accelerated deep learning for high-resolution computer vision
* new cryptographic primitives for federated learning
* frameworks for deep reinforcement learning and parameter tuning
* explainable reinforcement learning
* software platforms for autonomous vehicles
* new approaches to cloud computing

In 2020, Joseph launched a new stealth company based on his research to radically simplify the process of deploying advanced analytics and machine learning in modern data driven enterprises.  Prior to joining Berkeley, Joseph co-founded <a href="http://Turi.com">Turi Inc.</a> (formerly GraphLab), which was based on his thesis work on the <a href="https://github.com/dato-code/PowerGraph">GraphLab and PowerGraph Systems</a>.  Turi was eventually <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2016/exclusive-apple-acquires-turi-major-exit-seattle-based-machine-learning-ai-startup/">acquired</a> by Apple.




## News 


* We release [Gorilla Large Language Model](https://gorilla.cs.berkeley.edu/) ü¶ç LLMs need to interact with the world through APIs, and we teach LLMs to write APIs calls accurately without hallucination. 

* POET is featured by [IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/neural-network-training)! The first demonstration on how to train SOTA ML models on smartphones and resource constrained edge devices.

* Joseph is starting to explore some of the underlying design decisions in feature stores.  Checkout out recent blog [Feature Stores: The Data Side of ML Pipelines](https://medium.com/riselab/feature-stores-the-data-side-of-ml-pipelines-7083d69bff1c).

<!-- ## Prospective Postdocs and Graduate Students

I am currently looking for postdocs and graduate students to join the new <a href="https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu">UC Berkeley RISE Lab</a>.  As a founding member of the RISE Lab, I am working on several projects in large-scale systems for real-time machine learning, deep neural network design for accelerated computer vision, dynamic networks for multi-task learning, sparse representations for autonomous vehicles, software architectures for robotic systems, and explainable reinforcement learning.
My machine learning research spans both classical statistical machine learning methods as well as new work in deep learning.  If you are interested please consider applying to the UC Berkeley CS <a href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/academics/graduate/research-programs/admissions">graduate program</a> in <a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Areas/DBMS/">DBMS</a> or <a href ="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Areas/AI/">AI</a>.  
If you are looking for a post-doc position please contact me directly.
