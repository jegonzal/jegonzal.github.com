<div class="cards"><div id="luv22_abs" class="collapse abstract"><div class="card card-body">Large-scale semantic image annotation is a significant challenge for learning-based perception systems in robotics. Current approaches often rely on human labelers, which can be expensive, or simulation data, which can visually or physically differ from real data. This paper proposes Labels from UltraViolet (LUV), a novel framework that enables rapid, labeled data collection in real manipulation environments without human labeling. LUV uses transparent, ultraviolet-fluorescent paint with programmable ultraviolet LEDs to collect paired images of a scene in standard lighting and UV lighting to autonomously extract segmentation masks and keypoints via color segmentation. We apply LUV to a suite of diverse robot perception tasks to evaluate its labeling quality, flexibility, and data collection rate. Results suggest that LUV is 180-2500 times faster than a human labeler across the tasks. We show that LUV provides labels consistent with human annotations on unpainted test images.

 abstract = {Large-scale semantic image annotation is a significant challenge for learning-based perception systems in robotics. Current approaches often rely on human labelers, which can be expensive, or simulation data, which can visually or physically differ from real data. This paper proposes Labels from UltraViolet (LUV), a novel framework that enables rapid, labeled data collection in real manipulation environments without human labeling. LUV uses transparent, ultraviolet-fluorescent paint with programmable ultraviolet LEDs to collect paired images of a scene in standard lighting and UV lighting to autonomously extract segmentation masks and keypoints via color segmentation. We apply LUV to a suite of diverse robot perception tasks to evaluate its labeling quality, flexibility, and data collection rate. Results suggest that LUV is 180-2500 times faster than a human labeler across the tasks. We show that LUV provides labels consistent with human annotations on unpainted test images. The networks trained on these labels are used to smooth and fold crumpled towels with 83\% success rate and achieve 1.7mm position error with respect to human labels on a surgical needle pose estimation task. The low cost of LUV makes it ideal as a lightweight replacement for human labeling systems, with the one-time setup costs at \$300 equivalent to the cost of collecting around 200 semantic segmentation labels on Amazon Mechanical Turk.

However, while humans can say "I don't know" when they are uncertain (i.e., abstain from answering a question), such ability has been largely neglected in multimodal research, despite the importance of this problem to the usage of VQA in real settings. In this work, we promote a problem formulation for reliable VQA, where we prefer abstention over providing an incorrect answer. We first enable abstention capabilities for several VQA models, and analyze both their coverage, the portion of questions answered, and risk, the error on that portion. For that, we explore several abstention approaches. We find that although the best performing models achieve over 71\% accuracy on the VQA v2 dataset, introducing the option to abstain by directly using a model's softmax scores limits them to answering less than 8\% of the questions to achieve a low risk of error (i.e., 1\%). This motivates us to utilize a multimodal selection function to directly estimate the correctness of the predicted answers, which we show can increase the coverage by, for example, 2.4x from 6.8\% to 16.3\% at 1\% risk. While it is important to analyze both coverage and risk, these metrics have a trade-off which makes comparing VQA models challenging. To address this, we also propose an Effective Reliability metric for VQA that places a larger cost on incorrect answers compared to abstentions. This new problem formulation, metric, and analysis for VQA provide the groundwork for building effective and reliable VQA models that have the self-awareness to abstain if and only if they don't know the answer.</div></div><div id="reliableVAQ22_bib" class="collapse bibtex-entry"><div class="card card-body"><pre><code class="language-bib" data-lang="bib">

This speed-up however, is partly offset by the communication among cores, which results in lower throughput than if fewer cores were allocated to run more trials in parallel. In this paper, we explore these trade-offs in two settings. First, in a fixed confidence setting, we need to find the best arm with a given target success probability as quickly as possible. We propose an algorithm which trades off between information accumulation and throughput and show that the time taken can be upper bounded by the solution of a dynamic program whose inputs are the gaps between the sub-optimal and optimal arms. We also prove a matching hardness result. Second, we present an algorithm for a fixed deadline setting, where we are given a time deadline and need to maximize the probability of finding the best arm.

We propose an algorithm which trades off between information accumulation and throughput and show that the time taken can be upper bounded by the solution of a dynamic program whose inputs are the gaps between the sub-optimal and optimal arms. We also prove a matching hardness result. Second, we present an algorithm for a fixed deadline setting, where we are given a time deadline and need to maximize the probability of finding the best arm. We corroborate our theoretical insights with simulation experiments that show that the algorithms consistently match or outperform baseline algorithms on a variety of problem instances.},

We present TEGRA, a system that enables efficient ad-hoc window operations on evolving graphs. TEGRA allows efficient access to the state of the graph at arbitrary windows, and significantly accelerates ad-hoc window queries by using a compact in-memory representation for both graph and intermediate computation state. For this, it leverages persistent data structures to build a versioned, distributed graph state store, and couples it with an incremental computation model which can leverage these compact states. For users, it exposes these compact states using Timelapse, a natural abstraction.

 abstract = {Several emerging evolving graph application workloads demand support for efficient ad-hoc analytics---the ability to perform ad-hoc queries on arbitrary time windows of the graph. We present TEGRA, a system that enables efficient ad-hoc window operations on evolving graphs. TEGRA allows efficient access to the state of the graph at arbitrary windows, and significantly accelerates ad-hoc window queries by using a compact in-memory representation for both graph and intermediate computation state. For this, it leverages persistent data structures to build a versioned, distributed graph state store, and couples it with an incremental computation model which can leverage these compact states. For users, it exposes these compact states using Timelapse, a natural abstraction. We evaluate TEGRA against existing evolving graph analysis techniques, and show that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems (by up to 30×) for ad-hoc window operation workloads.},

Based on these results, we propose a novel grouping-based model averaging method to replace the FedAvg averaging method.

Data were obtained in a commonly available 12-lead ECG format from a single-center tertiary care institution. All patients aged 18 years or older who received ECGs at the University of California, San Francisco, were included, yielding a total of 365009 patients. Data were analyzed from January 1, 2019, to March 2, 2021.A CNN was trained to predict the presence of 38 diagnostic classes in 5 categories from 12-lead ECG data. A CNN explainability technique called LIME (Linear Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) was used to visualize ECG segments contributing to CNN diagnoses.Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity were calculated for the CNN in the holdout test data set against cardiologist clinical diagnoses. For a second validation, 3 electrophysiologists provided consensus committee diagnoses against which the CNN, cardiologist clinical diagnosis, and MUSE (GE Healthcare) automated analysis performance was compared using the F1 score; AUC, sensitivity, and specificity were also calculated for the CNN against the consensus committee.A total of 992748 ECGs from 365009 adult patients (mean [SD] age, 56.2 [17.6] years; 183600 women $[50.3\%]$; and 175277 White patients $[48.0\%]$) were included in the analysis. In 91440 test data set ECGs, the CNN demonstrated an AUC of at least 0.960 for 32 of 38 classes ($84.2\%$). Against the consensus committee diagnoses, the CNN had higher frequency-weighted mean F1 scores than both cardiologists and MUSE in all 5 categories (CNN frequency-weighted F1 score for rhythm, 0.812; conduction, 0.729; chamber diagnosis, 0.598; infarct, 0.674; and other diagnosis, 0.875). For 32 of 38 classes ($84.2\%$), the CNN had AUCs of at least 0.910 and demonstrated comparable F1 scores and higher sensitivity than cardiologists, except for atrial fibrillation (CNN F1 score, 0.847 vs cardiologist F1 score, 0.881), junctional rhythm (0.526 vs 0.727), premature ventricular complex (0.786 vs 0.800), and Wolff-Parkinson-White (0.800 vs 0.842). Compared with MUSE, the CNN had higher F1 scores for all classes except supraventricular tachycardia (CNN F1 score, 0.696 vs MUSE F1 score, 0.714). The LIME technique highlighted physiologically relevant ECG segments.The results of this cross-sectional study suggest that readily available ECG data can be used to train a CNN algorithm to achieve comparable performance to clinical cardiologists and exceed the performance of MUSE automated analysis for most diagnoses, with some exceptions.

Coronary angiography is the gold standard for coronary heart disease (CHD) evaluation, but relies upon ad-hoc visual assessment which suffers from high variability and poor reproducibility. We developed a pipeline of deep neural network algorithms (CathAI) that accomplishes the tasks necessary for automated assessment of coronary stenosis severity from coronary angiograms.

CathAI used angiograms designed to flow sequentially from Algorithms 1 to 4, to achieve automated angiogram interpretation (Figure 1) using UCSF data from April 2008 to December 2019. CathAI-predicted stenosis severity was compared against the clinical angiographic report for that artery segment.

A total of 13,843 angiographic studies were obtained from $11972$ patients.

Algorithm 3 identified $73.1\%$ of the stenoses that were described in procedural reports. To discriminate clinically significant ($\geq 70\%$) stenosis, Algorithm 4 exhibited an area under the curve of 0.836 ($95\%$ CI: $0.817-0.856$) at the artery-level; specificity was $80.0\%$ at a sensitivity of $71.0\%$. Fully automated coronary angiogram analysis is feasible. CathAI demonstrated proficiency in all tasks required to interpret real-world angiograms.

In this work, we develop a general-purpose contingency planner that is learned end-to-end using high-dimensional scene observations and low-dimensional behavioral observations. We use a conditional autoregressive flow model to create a compact contingency planning space, and show how this model can tractably learn contingencies from behavioral observations.

In response, previous work combines decision trees with deep learning, yielding models that (1) sacrifice interpretability for accuracy or (2) sacrifice accuracy for interpretability. We forgo this dilemma by jointly improving accuracy and interpretability using Neural-Backed Decision Trees (NBDTs). NBDTs replace a neural network's final linear layer with a differentiable sequence of decisions and a surrogate loss. This forces the model to learn high-level concepts and lessens reliance on highly-uncertain decisions, yielding (1) accuracy: NBDTs match or outperform modern neural networks on CIFAR, ImageNet and better generalize to unseen classes by up to 16\%. Furthermore, our surrogate loss improves the original model's accuracy by up to 2\%.

 abstract = {Machine learning applications such as finance and medicine demand accurate and justifiable predictions, barring most deep learning methods from use. In response, previous work combines decision trees with deep learning, yielding models that (1) sacrifice interpretability for accuracy or (2) sacrifice accuracy for interpretability. We forgo this dilemma by jointly improving accuracy and interpretability using Neural-Backed Decision Trees (NBDTs). NBDTs replace a neural network's final linear layer with a differentiable sequence of decisions and a surrogate loss. This forces the model to learn high-level concepts and lessens reliance on highly-uncertain decisions, yielding (1) accuracy: NBDTs match or outperform modern neural networks on CIFAR, ImageNet and better generalize to unseen classes by up to 16\%. Furthermore, our surrogate loss improves the original model's accuracy by up to 2\%. NBDTs also afford (2) interpretability: improving human trustby clearly identifying model mistakes and assisting in dataset debugging.},

Previous exploration methods (e.g., RND) have achieved strong results in multiple hard tasks. However, if there are multiple novel areas to explore, these methods often focus quickly on one without sufficiently trying others (like a depth-wise first search manner). In some scenarios (e.g., four corridor environment in Sec 4.2), we observe they explore in one corridor for long and fail to cover all the states. On the other hand, in theoretical RL, with optimistic initialization and the inverse square root of visitation count as a bonus, it won't suffer from this and explores different novel regions alternatively (like a breadth-first search manner). In this paper, inspired by this, we propose a simple but effective criterion called NovelD by weighting every novel area approximately equally. Our algorithm is very simple but yet shows comparable performance or even outperforms multiple SOTA exploration methods in many hard exploration tasks. Specifically, NovelD solves all the static procedurally-generated tasks in Mini-Grid with just 120M environment steps, without any curriculum learning. In comparison, the previous SOTA only solves 50\% of them. NovelD also achieves SOTA on multiple tasks in NetHack, a rogue-like game that contains more challenging procedurally-generated environments. In multiple Atari games (e.g., MonteZuma's Revenge, Venture, Gravitar), NovelD outperforms RND.

We present two algorithms that enhance robust cable untangling, LOKI and SPiDERMan, which operate alongside HULK, a high-level planner from prior work.

Serverless computing is a new paradigm that promises to free cloud users from the burden of having to provision and manage resources. However, the degree to which serverless computing will replace provisioned servers remains an open question.

To address this, we develop an economic model that aims to quantify the value of serverless to providers and customers. A simple model of incentives for rational providers and customers allows us to see, in broad strokes, when and why serverless technologies are worth pursuing. By characterizing the conditions under which mutually beneficial economic incentives exist, our model suggests that many classes of customers can already benefit from switching to a serverless model and taking advantage of autoscaling at today's price points. Our model also helps characterize technical research directions that would be likely to have impact in the market.

Since hardware resources are limited, the objective of training deep learning models is typically to maximize accuracy subject to the time and memory constraints of training and inference. We study the impact of model size in this setting, focusing on Transformer models for NLP tasks that are limited by compute: self-supervised pretraining and high-resource machine translation. We first show that even though smaller Transformer models execute faster per iteration, wider and deeper models converge in significantly fewer steps. Moreover, this acceleration in convergence typically outpaces the additional computational overhead of using larger models. Therefore, the most compute-efficient training strategy is to counterintuitively train extremely large models but stop after a small number of iterations.

This leads to an apparent trade-off between the training efficiency of large Transformer models and the inference efficiency of small Transformer models. However, we show that large models are more robust to compression techniques such as quantization and pruning than small models. Consequently, one can get the best of both worlds: heavily compressed, large models achieve higher accuracy than lightly compressed, small models.

The dominant cost in production machine learning workloads is not training individual models but serving predictions from increasingly complex prediction pipelines spanning multiple models, machine learning frameworks, and parallel hardware accelerators. Due to the complex interaction between model configurations and parallel hardware, prediction pipelines are challenging to provision and costly to execute when serving interactive latency-sensitive applications. This challenge is exacerbated by the unpredictable dynamics of bursty workloads.

In this paper we introduce InferLine, a system which efficiently provisions and executes ML inference pipelines subject to end-to-end latency constraints by proactively optimizing and reactively controlling per-model configuration in a fine-grained fashion. Unpredictable changes in the serving workload are dynamically and cost-optimally accommodated with minimal service level degradation. InferLine introduces (1) automated model profiling and pipeline lineage extraction, (2) a fine-grain, cost-minimizing pipeline configuration planner, and (3) a fine-grain reactive controller. InferLine is able to configure and deploy prediction pipelines across a wide range of workload patterns and latency goals. It outperforms coarse-grained configuration alternatives by up 7.6x in cost while achieving up to 32x lower SLO miss rate on real workloads and generalizes across state-of-the-art model serving frameworks.

High-performance tensor programs are crucial to guarantee efficient execution of deep neural networks.

Currently, deep learning systems rely on vendor-provided kernel libraries or various search strategies to get performant tensor programs. These approaches either require significant engineering effort to develop platform-specific optimization code or fall short of finding high-performance programs due to restricted search space and ineffective exploration strategy.

We present Ansor, a tensor program generation framework for deep learning applications. Compared with existing search strategies, Ansor explores many more optimization combinations by sampling programs from a hierarchical representation of the search space. Ansor then fine-tunes the sampled programs with evolutionary search and a learned cost model to identify the best programs. Ansor can find high-performance programs that are outside the search space of existing state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, Ansor utilizes a task scheduler to simultaneously optimize multiple subgraphs in deep neural networks.

Coopetitive analytics refers to cooperation among competing parties to run queries over their joint data. Regulatory, business, and liability concerns prevent these organizations from sharing their sensitive data in plaintext.

OCQ builds on Opaque, a Spark-based framework for secure distributed analytics, to execute coopetitive queries using hardware enclaves in a decentralized manner. Its query planner chooses how and where to execute each relational operator to prevent data leakage through side channels such as memory access patterns, network traffic statistics, and cardinality, while minimizing overhead.

We implemented OCQ as an extension to Apache Spark SQL. We find that OCQ is up to 9.9x faster than Opaque, a state-of-the-art secure analytics framework which outsources all data and computation to an enclave-enabled cloud; and is up to 219x faster than implementing analytics using AgMPC, a state-of-the-art secure multi-party computation framework.

Scaling video analytics to massive camera deployments, however, presents a new and mounting challenge, as compute cost grows proportionally to the number of camera feeds.

The spatial similarity of nearby video frames, however, suggests opportunity to reuse computation. Existing work has explored basic feature reuse and feature warping based on optical flow, but has encountered limits to the speedup attainable with these techniques. In this paper, we present a new, two part approach to accelerating inference on video. First, we propose a fast feature propagation technique that utilizes the block motion vectors present in compressed video (e.g. H.264 codecs) to cheaply propagate features from frame to frame. Second, we develop a novel feature estimation scheme, termed feature interpolation, that fuses features propagated from enclosing keyframes to render accurate feature estimates, even at sparse keyframe frequencies. We evaluate our system on the Cityscapes and CamVid datasets, comparing to both a frame-by-frame baseline and related work. We find that we are able to substantially accelerate segmentation on video, achieving near real-time frame rates (20.1 frames per second) on large images (960 x 720 pixels), while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Machine learning is being deployed in a growing number of applications which demand real-time, accurate, and robust predictions under heavy query load. However, most machine learning frameworks and systems only address model training and not deployment.

In this paper, we introduce Clipper, a general-purpose low-latency prediction serving system. Interposing between end-user applications and a wide range of machine learning frameworks, Clipper introduces a modular architecture to simplify model deployment across frameworks and applications. Furthermore, by introducing caching, batching, and adaptive model selection techniques, Clipper reduces prediction latency and improves prediction throughput, accuracy, and robustness without modifying the underlying machine learning frameworks. We evaluate Clipper on four common machine learning benchmark datasets and demonstrate its ability to meet the latency, accuracy, and throughput demands of online serving applications. Finally, we compare Clipper to the Tensorflow Serving system and demonstrate that we are able to achieve comparable throughput and latency while enabling model composition and online learning to improve accuracy and render more robust predictions.

<div class="cards"><div id="DistGraphlab12_abs" class="collapse abstract"><div class="card card-body">While high-level data parallel frameworks, like MapReduce, simplify the design and implementation of large-scale data processing systems, they do not naturally or efficiently support many important data mining and machine learning algorithms and can lead to inefficient learning systems. To help fill this critical void, we introduced the GraphLab abstraction which naturally expresses asynchronous, dynamic, graph-parallel computation while ensuring data consistency and achieving a high degree of parallel performance in the shared-memory setting.

 abstract = {While high-level data parallel frameworks, like MapReduce, simplify the design and implementation of large-scale data processing systems, they do not naturally or efficiently support many important data mining and machine learning algorithms and can lead to inefficient learning systems. To help fill this critical void, we introduced the GraphLab abstraction which naturally expresses asynchronous, dynamic, graph-parallel computation while ensuring data consistency and achieving a high degree of parallel performance in the shared-memory setting.

Latent variable techniques are pivotal in tasks ranging from predicting user click patterns and targeting ads to organizing the news and managing user generated content. Latent variable techniques like topic modeling, clustering, and subspace estimation provide substantial insight into the latent structure of complex data with little or no external guidance making them ideal for reasoning about large-scale, rapidly evolving datasets. Unfortunately, due to the data dependencies and global state introduced by latent variables and the iterative nature of latent variable inference, latent-variable techniques are often prohibitively expensive to apply to large-scale, streaming datasets.

In this paper we present a scalable parallel framework for efficient inference in latent variable models over streaming web-scale data. Our framework addresses three key challenges: 1) synchronizing the global state which includes global latent variables (e.g., cluster centers and dictionaries); 2) efficiently storing and retrieving the large local state which includes the data-points and their corresponding latent variables (e.g., cluster membership); and 3) sequentially incorporating streaming data (e.g., the news). We address these challenges by introducing: 1) a novel delta-based aggregation system with a bandwidth-efficient communication protocol; 2) schedule-aware out-of-core storage; and 3) approximate forward sampling to rapidly incorporate new data. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of our framework by easily tackling datasets two orders of magnitude larger than those addressed by the current state-of-the-art.
